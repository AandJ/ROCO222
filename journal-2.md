## Making a Motor  
first we used the adhesive copper tape to cover one end of the cork to create a surface for the brushes to interact with.
we used approximately 10M of copper wire to wind around the cork, this total 111 turns.
we measured the resistance of this to be 5.6 ohms.

## Improved Motor
To improve upon the motor we decided we would use more coils of wire, the benefit to this is than with more than one coil the motor 
will be able to start spinning from any position whereas with a single coil no torque will be produced when the wires are at 
90 degrees to the magnet. Another benefit to more coils is that the torque is produced at a more constant rate, this means that
the more coils you have the less the torque varies.  We decided to only use 60 windings of wire per coil rather than the previous 111,
this is because we need to make sure the wires fit around the motor.

We also designed an improved stand to hold the motor so that its rotation would be more uniform, we decided to 3D print the stand as it allowed us a more complex shape,
we also chose 3D printing over other options as it is something we had not done before and we wished to gain experience with the technique.

Once all the components had been printed we assembled the motor, we set up the brushes and ran the motor to check that it spins.

it was visible that the motor span significantly faster than the previous design. To confirm this we built and encoder which would allow us to determine the speed at which our motor span, we used an Arduino and a circular disk with a slot cut out to measure the number of times a beam of light was broken, the result would then be output to a terminal. we used the Arduino line plotter feature to give us a graph of motor speed.

Our motors speed varied significantly due to are low quality componets and the fact that the contact between the brushes of the motor were loose meaning at some points of its rotation more than one coil was conected, this could be fixed by designer a better more stable brush.
